                                We believe existing social media platforms are suppressing
                                users' reach and content to increase ad revenue.
                            </h1>

                                We believe in order for ad-based platforms like Instagram to
                                make money they must suppress the reach of users. If a user
                                can reach millions of people with their content, brands would
                                pay the user directly and not pay Instagram for ads. Therefore
                                Instagram must intentionally limit the reach of your content
                                by not showing it to all your followers.
                            </p>

                                More and more users on these platforms are increasingly
                                frustrated. We have entered a true crisis in which the
                                platforms are getting rich off of the creativity of the users,
                                but own a monopoly on the advertising and revenue stemming
                                from the entire user base.

                                issues, they do not provide the organic ability to grow their
                                following on the platform, leaving users without a current
                                major following on other platforms in the dark. Some current
                                platforms that monetize lean toward mainly adult content,
                                which does not instill confidence in the plethora of creator
                                types out there looking to monetize. Also making them
                                non-brand safe.

                                Instagram and its attempts to mimic rival platform Tiktok. The
                                changes have affected the algorithm and visibility of their

                                Fanbase bridges the gap between traditional social platforms
                                with the monetization aspects of other subscription-based
                                applications by giving users the opportunity to do both
                                natively in our application. Users can grow their organic
                                followings and find their audience while also offering
                                subscriber paid content for those who want exclusive access.

                                The ability for users to reach every single person that
                                follows them creates the opportunity to generate limitless

                                and platforms that monetize from running ads.

                                                    <p>Once your investment is canceled, there is a 10-day clearing
                                                        period (from the date your investment was submitted). After your
                                                        funds have cleared the bank, you will receive your refund within
                                                        10 business days.</p>
                                                    <p>Refunds that are made through ACH payments can take up to 10
                                                        business days to clear. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of
                                                        the bank, but we will do everything we can to get you your
                                                        refund as soon as possible. However, every investment needs to
                                                        go through the clearing process in order to get sent back to the
                                                        account associated with the investment.</p>
