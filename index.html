                                    Fanbase is a new frontier of social media, placing microcast
                                    and monetization capability at the forefront to the benefit of
                                    all users. By allowing any user to make money from their
                                    social content, they have the opportunity to create enormous
                                    consistent monthly revenue via their audience and increase
                                    authentic user engagement among their most interested
                                    followers. Fanbase users can post photos, videos, short form
                                    videos, create audio rooms, stories, broadcast live and post
                                    long form content to the platform to engage with audiences in
                                    a multitude of ways.

                                    We believe existing social media platforms are suppressing
                                    users' reach and content to increase ad revenue.
                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    We believe in order for ad-based platforms like Instagram to
                                    make money they must suppress the reach of users. If a user
                                    can reach millions of people with their content, brands would
                                    pay the user directly and not pay Instagram for ads. Therefore
                                    Instagram must intentionally limit the reach of your content
                                    by not showing it to all your followers.
                                </p>

                                    More and more users on these platforms are increasingly
                                    frustrated. We have entered a true crisis in which the
                                    platforms are getting rich off of the creativity of the users,
                                    but own a monopoly on the advertising and revenue stemming
                                    from the entire user base.

                                    Although other platforms are attempting to address these
                                    issues, they do not provide the organic ability to grow their
                                    following on the platform, leaving users without a current
                                    major following on other platforms in the dark. Some current
                                    platforms that monetize lean toward mainly adult content,
                                    which does not instill confidence in the plethora of creator
                                    types out there looking to monetize. Also making them
                                    non-brand safe.

                                    In July and September of 2022, celebrities Kim Kardiashian,
                                    Kylie Jenner, and Cardi B expressed their frustration with
                                    Instagram and its attempts to mimic rival platform Tiktok. The
                                    changes have affected the algorithm and visibility of their
                                    content, resulting in lower engagement with users.

                                    In August of 2022, social media platform Triller was hit with
                                    a flurry of lawsuits and accusations from producers Swizz
                                    Beatz and Timbaland, Sony Music, and numerous other Black
                                    creators. The claims failure to pay for “Verzus”, music
                                    royalties, and a black creator program.

                                    We believe creators contribute so much to social media

                                    Fanbase bridges the gap between traditional social platforms
                                    with the monetization aspects of other subscription-based
                                    applications by giving users the opportunity to do both
                                    natively in our application. Users can grow their organic
                                    followings and find their audience while also offering
                                    subscriber paid content for those who want exclusive access.

                                    The ability for users to reach every single person that
                                    follows them creates the opportunity to generate limitless
                                    amounts of revenue and simultaneously engage with their
                                    suppressed audience. That is the difference between Fanbase
                                    and platforms that monetize from running ads.

                                            <p>Hi, I invested last February at $8.61 per share, but I see it is now
                                                $3.95 a share, can someone explain the difference?</p> <br>

                                            <p>I see someone mentioned a potential stock split, if this is the case I
                                                don't see that reflected in my account.</p>

                                            <p>Thanks for your detailed and forward thinking questions. As an early
                                                investor in @fanbase, I asked him if @fanbase is transitioning to WEB 3
                                                because that's the future but he says not now, and now twiiiitter is
                                                actively a fanbase copycat. Furthermore more, I have changed most of my
                                                social media videos to have the @fanbase logo
                                                because I must use what I invested in but no matter how you tag him and
                                                @fanbase on social media he will not show appreciation for your
                                                investment, yet he has all the time to express his opinion on social
                                                media platforms about people who have never heard about @fanbase. My
                                                question is why criticize other social media platforms for suppressing
                                                Brown and Black contents when you doing the same?? I AM 100% African and

                                            <p>Two questions: 1) 270K users sounds like a lot but it really is not in
                                                the scheme of things - anything less than a million engaged users makes
                                                this easy to die off b/c the social media space is so crowded now - how
                                                will you increase you users? Google ads? Youtube ads? Both? It is all
                                                about network effect for social media platforms and this seems lacking.
                                                Second question, your "virtual currency" token, "Love", is this a public
                                                blockchain of some kind? Like an Ethereum token? If so, I am concerned
                                                about that because public / private key encryption for many of these
                                                blockchains (like Ethereum or bitcoin) is ECDSA which is vulnerable in
                                                the next decade or so to hacks from quantum computers. So this is a big
                                                problem - if "Love" is an Eth token you should take precautions to not
                                                expose the public keys to users b/c quantum computers will in a decade
                                                or so be able to consume exposed public keys and figure out the
                                                associated private keys and help themselves to all the "love", lol.
                                                Please address both of these points, which I am sure others are also
                                                thinking about, thank you. </p>

                                            <p>Hi Isaac,</p>

                                            <p>I made a second investment in fanbase for 633 shares before the recent
                                                deadline. It's been sitting in "funds received" status since. It's been
                                                there before the recent deadline hit. My funds haven't been invested
                                                yet, I've sent three messages to start engine support with no response.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Can you please help get me some clarification as to if my funds will be
                                                invested or if I need to cancel and get a refund???</p>
